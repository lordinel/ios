Missing DRs

SELECT
	CONCAT(z.expected, IF(z.got-1>z.expected, CONCAT(' thru ',z.got-1), '')) AS missing
FROM (
	SELECT
		@rownum:=@rownum+1 AS expected,
		IF(@rownum=delivery_receipt, 0, @rownum:=delivery_receipt) AS got
	FROM
		(SELECT @rownum:=0) AS a
		JOIN `order`
		ORDER BY delivery_receipt * 1
	) AS z
WHERE z.got!=0;


DRs that cannot be sorted
SELECT id, delivery_receipt FROM `order` WHERE (delivery_receipt * 1 = 0) AND delivery_receipt IS NOT NULL
